# Pope Francis' US Speeches

Description:
I wanted to perform a quick analysis of the words Pope Francis used in his speeches during his visit to the US in September 2015.

There are four text files in the text directory that were used in this R script:
- "PopeFrancis-CongressSpeech-09-14-2015.txt"
- "PopeFrancis-PAPrisonSpeech-09-27-2015.txt"
- "PopeFrancis-USBishopsSpeech-09-##-2015.txt"
- "PopeFrancis-WhiteHouseSpeech-09-##-2015.txt"

This script generates two artifacts:
A plot of words used more than 10 times:

and a wordcloud of words used more than 5 times
